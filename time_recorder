I really dont understand this Discord stuff well enough yet
it's fine, discord.py is a bit of a mess
also the community is evil
Most dev communities are evil

the undertale fandom of dev communities
mhm

Reminder that disc.py can do all permissions role and user calculation before you even start to handle the command-le
